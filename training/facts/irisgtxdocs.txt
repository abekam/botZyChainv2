Introduction
Zebra  Iris GTX combines the integration of a conventional smart camera with
the flexibility of a traditional PC-based machine vision system. Zebra  Iris GTX
is a fully programmable device, allowing extensive customization. Zebra 
Iris GTX comes pre-installed with the Zebra  Design Assistant runtime
environment.
Zebra  Design Assistant is an intuitive, flowchart-based, integrated development
environment (IDE). System integrators and professional end-users can easily and
quickly develop and deploy machine vision applications on a highly integrated
platform without the need for traditional programming skills. The integrated
development environment provides access to a comprehensive set of
highly-efficient and field-proven image analysis and measurement tools.
Zebra  Iris GTX features an Intel-architecture processor, and uses a global shutter
CMOS image sensor from a range of monochrome and color options. The CMOS
image sensor allows the exposure phase of a triggered grab to occur while the
previous image is being transferred. The Intel-architecture processor is an Intel
Atom x6211E processor. The 32-Gbyte eMMC (flash disk) provides in-camera
(on-board) storage for both the operating system and additional data. 4 Gbytes
of LPDDR4x SDRAM provides in-camera (on-board) volatile storage.
Zebra  Iris GTX is fully integrated in an IP67 enclosure, eliminating the need to
separately source a sealed camera housing, while still providing easy access to the
lens.

Introduction 9
Zebra  Iris GTX can connect to a display device through the VGA/USB
connector and it can communicate with other devices through the Gigabit
Ethernet network interface (100/1000 BaseT) and digital auxiliary I/O signals.
An advanced I/O engine is included to allow you to communicate and coordinate
events using the auxiliary I/O signals (for example, to trigger and set the duration
of the exposure).
The network interface can be used for general purpose, Gigabit network
communication, or for communication with external devices using the
PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, CCLink, or Modbus industrial protocols. For
PROFINET communication on the network interface, Zebra  Iris GTX provides
a PROFINET engine with a hardware-assisted PROFINET interface. The
hardware-assisted interface supports a minimum I/O cycle time of 1 msec.

Software overview
The Zebra  Iris GTX with Design Assistant is distributed with Zebra  Design
Assistant, a flowchart-based, integrated development environment (IDE). It
allows you to create an imaging application without writing a single line of code.
Application development is a step-by-step approach, where each step is taken from
an existing toolbox and is configured through a series of dialog windows. Zebra 
Design Assistant runs on your development computer and uses the resources of
your Zebra  Iris GTX smart camera (for example, to grab an image and
communicate with connected devices) to build projects. Once the project is built,
it runs on your Zebra  Iris GTX without relying on the resources of your
development computer.
With Zebra  Design Assistant, you can:
(cid:129) Create your project as a series of steps using a flowchart.
(cid:129) Test your project from your computer without any additional code editors or
compilers and without deploying (copying and running) your project on your
Zebra  Iris GTX.
(cid:129) Design and layout a web page (operator view) to receive operator input and to
display your project's output.

Adding Zebra  Iris GTX to your network
Corporate-wide networks typically use DHCP servers to assign each connected
device an IP address. If your Zebra  Iris GTX is still in its factory-configured state,
and your network uses a DHCP server, no configuration is required to use your
Zebra  Iris GTX on your network.
Much of the information found in this section is directed to users with a Zebra 
Iris GTX camera with Zebra  Design Assistant, because in this case, the camera
uses the Zebra  Imaging Operating System (MIOS).
Device name (AUTO NETNAME)
By default, Zebra  Iris GTX comes factory configured with a device name
(AUTO NETNAME), which can be found on a sticker attached to your Zebra 
Iris GTX smart camera and is unique for each camera. If you are connecting to a
static network, use the IP address of the camera; otherwise, if you are connected
to a DHCP network, this name is used:
GTXxxxxxx
The xxxxxx corresponds to the six hexadecimal digits of your Zebra  Iris GTX’s
MAC address. This can be changed to a more meaningful name through the
Zebra  Design Assistant configuration portal.
The Zebra  Design Assistant configuration portal on your Zebra  Iris GTX is
located at http:\\GTXxxxxxx, where GTXxxxxxx is your smart camera’s device
name. This portal allows you to manage many aspects of your smart camera (for
example, configure settings, manage projects, and set up communication). You
can change network settings in the TCP/IP tab of the Administration page (gear
icon), where you can also change the device name (AUTO NETNAME) of your
camera.
Using a static IP address with networks that do not use DHCP
If your network does not use DHCP, you must access and configure your Zebra 
Iris GTX to use a static IP address. To access Zebra  Iris GTX when you don’t
know its current IP address, you can physically connect to it or use the Zebra 
System Discovery (MtxSysDiscovery) utility on your development computer.

Administration page by clicking on the gear button.
4. Click on the TCP/IP tab.
5. Enter the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address in the spaces provided.
When done, click on the Save settings button.
Your IP address is now changed.
Using the Zebra  System Discovery utility for Zebra  Iris GTX
If you do not know your Zebra  Iris GTX’s IP address, you can use the Zebra 
System Discovery (MtxSysDiscovery) utility to access it and change its IP address;
to do so, perform the following:
1. On your development computer (where Zebra  Design Assistant is installed),
launch the MIL Control Center utility.
2. In the MIL Control Center utility, select Design Assistant Tools for the version
of Zebra  Design Assistant.
3. In the Design Assistant Tools directory, select and run the Zebra  System

Connecting to the auxiliary I/O interface
Zebra  Iris GTX has an auxiliary I/O interface with 7 optically isolated auxiliary
signals. Four are inputs that support sinking and sourcing configurations and can
receive 24 V. Three are outputs that support sinking configurations and operate
at up to 24 V nominal; you could connect one of the outputs in a sourcing
configuration, but the other two outputs would no longer be available. Zebra 
Iris GTX also has an analog intensity (dimming) control signal, which is discussed
in the Connecting a light controller and the analog intensity control signal section
later in this chapter.
Note that sinking and sourcing concepts refer to the conventional current flow,
which means current flows from the positive potential towards the negative
potential. A sinking device provides a path to sink current towards ground or to
the return path; a sinking device does not provide power. A sourcing device
provides a path that sources current; it provides a path from the power source. In
the following diagram, the device on the right is the sourcing device, and the device
on the left is the sinking device.

Connecting devices to the auxiliary output signals
Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals can be interfaced with input modules
(with sourcing or sinking input signals) found on most programmable logic
controllers (PLCs) and other devices. The auxiliary output signals can also be
interfaced with inductive load devices (such as a relay or a small motor).
The Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals are sinking output signals, based
on an NPN-type transistor. They need to be connected to an external power source
because on their own, they are not capable of providing voltage to drive a device.
They are typically connected in a sinking configuration because they only have
one dedicated pin (AUX_OUT0, AUX_OUT1, AUX_OUT2, respectively) and
share their other pin (AUX_OUT_COMMON). So, typically, a sourcing device
is connected to their dedicated pin and the return path is connected to the
common pin. The exact connection between the output signal, the connected
device, and the power source depends on the type of device to which you connect.

is connected to the power supply. However, in this configuration, the other two
auxiliary output signals are not available. The exact connection between the output
signal, the connected device, and the power source depends entirely on the type
of device to which you connect.

32 Chapter 2: Powering and connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX
To add pullup or pull-down circuitry, attach an external pullup or pull-down
resistor, respectively. A resistance value of 3 KOhms is suggested to protect your
Zebra  Iris GTX. Since your Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals can sink
up to 50 mA, use the documentation of your input to calculate the required
resistance for your external pullup/pull-down resistor (if necessary).
In the connections above, the pullup circuitry causes an inversion if the input of
the device is connected to the AUX_OUT pin. When the auxiliary output signal
is on, the circuit between its AUX_OUT and AUX_OUT_COMMON pins is
closed, and current flows from the power source to the AUX_OUT_COMMON
pin. So the observed voltage at the AUX_OUT pin will be low. Whereas, when
the auxiliary output signal is off, the circuit between its AUX_OUT and
AUX_OUT_COMMON pins is open, and current flows from the power source
to the input of the device. In this state, the current is limited by the pullup’s resistor
value.
Warning The Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals are compatible with voltages up to
24 V. However, by default, the auxiliary output signals offer low resistance. When
they are on (their circuit is closed), current flows directly through them. Ensure
that the circuit created between the power source, the output signal, the connected
device, and return path does not cause more than 50 mA to flow through the
signal.
As a precaution, the auxiliary output signals are individually fuse-protected up to
50 mA. Zebra  Iris GTX uses resettable fuses. The fuses protect Zebra  Iris GTX
if you accidentally connect their corresponding auxiliary output signal to a device
that sources/sinks more current than Zebra  Iris GTX can safely transmit. If more
than 50 mA of current goes through your Zebra  Iris GTX, the fuse will
eventually trip. After disconnecting your Zebra  Iris GTX, the fuse will reset only
after it has sufficiently cooled,

Connecting devices to the auxiliary input signals
Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary input signals can be interfaced with a wide variety of
devices (such as proximity detectors). The Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary input signals
only detect when current flows between their AUX_IN pin and
AUX_IN_COMMON pin. As such, an auxiliary input signal must be connected
to a device that controls the flow of current. When current is detected, the signal
is reported as on; otherwise, it is reported as off. In software, you can enable an
interrupt to be generated the moment current is detected. For information on the
electrical specifications of the on and off voltage levels, see the Electrical
specifications section, in Appendix B: Technical reference.
Each of the four available auxiliary input signals has one dedicated pin (AUX_IN3,
AUX_IN4, AUX_IN5, and AUX_IN6, respectively) and shares its other pin
(AUX_IN_COMMON) with the other auxiliary input signals.
You can connect the auxiliary input signals in a sinking or sourcing configuration.
Since the auxiliary input signals share a common pin, they have to be all in a
sinking configuration or all in a sourcing configuration. The exact connection
between the input signal, the connected device, and the power source depends
entirely on the type of device to which you connect. You should essentially connect
your device respecting the following:

Pullup circuitry In some cases, you must add pullup circuitry to connect an output device to an
auxiliary input signal; specifically, you must attach an external pullup resistor
between the voltage source and the AUX_IN pin.
This is required when you connect the AUX_IN_COMMON pin to the electrical
return path and the third-party output device is in a sinking configuration. In this
case, select a resistor value that will not overcurrent the output device and instead
provide just enough current and voltage to your Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary input
signals, according to the Electrical specifications subsection in
Appendix B: Technical reference. Note that you should use a resistor with an
appropriate power rating for your circuit.

Connecting a light controller and the analog
intensity control signal
Zebra  Iris GTX includes an auxiliary I/O engine, with an analog intensity
control signal (AUX_AREF_OUT7), which provides a slow changing analog
intensity (dimming) control signal from 0-10 VDC. This control signal can be
used to set the intensity for a light controller (for example, with an Advanced
Illumination inline control system or Smart Vision Lights brick light); however,
it should not be used to draw any current or drive power.
To set the intensity of the light controller using Zebra  Design Assistant, chose
Physical Camera under the Cameras item of the Platform configuration dialog,
and enter a value for Intensity. See the Grab and auxiliary I/O overview section of
the Zebra  Iris GTX appendix in the Zebra  Design Assistant help file for more

Connecting a light controller and the analog intensity control signal 49
Connecting a sinking light controller (PNP Pin)
If your lighting controller has a PNP pin (sinking input signal), it expects to be
connected in a PNP topology, whereby the connected, controlling auxiliary output
signal sources the current and the input pin sinks current. To do so, connect the
sinking light controller to an auxiliary output signal and the analog intensity
control signal (AUX_AREF_OUT7) of Zebra  Iris GTX as shown below.1
Note that in this configuration, the other two auxiliary output signals
(AUX_OPTOIND_OUTn) from Zebra  Iris GTX are not available.

1. When the auxiliary output signal is on, the circuit between
AUX_OPTOIND_OUT0 and AUX_OPTOIND_OUT_COMMON is closed.
This allows current to flow from AUX_OPTOIND_OUT0 to
AUX_OPTOIND_OUT_COMMON, and to the trigger input of the lighting con-
troller. When the auxiliary output signal is off, the circuit is open and no current flows
through.

(cid:129) Auxiliary signal.
An auxiliary signal is a user-defined I/O signal that can have one or more additional
functions. For example, a signal that can be both a trigger signal and a user-defined
input signal, is an auxiliary signal.
• IP67 enclosure.
An IP67 enclosure is a specific type of industrial enclosure that is dust and
water-tight. The name is derived using the incarnation protection rating (or
ingress protection code), and defined in the international standard IEC 60529.
(cid:129) Sinking.
A DC circuit that provides the common reference (low) for the circuit. In the case
of your Zebra  Iris GTX, determining whether the connection is sinking or
sourcing determines how to connect the auxiliary input common signal and
auxiliary output common signal, respectively.
(cid:129) Sourcing.
A DC circuit that provides the voltage needed for the circuit. In the case of your
Zebra  Iris GTX, determining whether the connection is sinking or sourcing
determines how to connect the auxiliary input common signal and auxiliary
output common signal, respectively.
(cid:129) Wire-terminal.
A wire-terminal is designed to receive a stripped wire; the stripped wire can carry
a signal. Typically, multiple wire-terminals are grouped together into an open-wire
connector.

Zebra  Iris GTX smart camera summary 55
CPU board
The CPU board of Zebra  Iris GTX has the following features:
(cid:129) SOC/CPU: Atom x6211E processor.
(cid:129) Volatile memory: 4 Gbytes of LPDDR4x SDRAM.
(cid:129) Non-volatile memory: 32 Gbytes of flash disk (eMMC) memory.
(cid:129) Networking: One 100/1000 Mbits (or 100 Mbit/1 Gbit) Ethernet networking
interface. This interface can be used for communicating with external devices
using the PROFINET, EtherNetI/P, CCLink, or Modbus protocol. For
PROFINET, Zebra  Iris GTX provides a hardware-assisted PROFINET interface
that support a minimum I/O cycle time of 1 msec. When using the
hardware-assisted PROFINET interface, it will create a second Ethernet
communication device with its own independent MAC address and IP
settings.The LAN connection associated with the hardware-assisted PROFINET
interface can be shared with other traffic.
(cid:129) An advanced I/O engine that includes the following:
- Digital I/Os: 4 inputs and 3 outputs.
❯ 4 opto-isolated, digital auxiliary input signals (24V).
❯ Input signals have interrupt generation capabilities.
❯ Input signals can sink or source. To source voltage, you must connect an
auxiliary voltage source to the common input signal
(AUX_OPTOIND_IN_COMMON). For voltage expectations, see
Electrical specifications subsection of the Zebra  Iris GTX specifications
section, later in this appendix. Whether all the input signals are sinking or
sourcing is dependent upon the connection of the common input signal.
❯ Input signals are debounced (that is, configured to wait a given amount of
time between accepting a signal change). The debouncing time can be
configured using Zebra  Design Assistant. For more information, refer to
the Zebra  Design Assistant help file.

❯ 3 opto-isolated auxiliary output signals (up to 24 V). Note that these
auxiliary output signals are sinking signals that share a common signal. If
one of these signals is used as a sourcing signal, the other two are no longer
available.
- One analog output. A 0-10 V signal designed to connect to the 0-10 V analog
intensity control pin of a light controller (such as, an Advanced Illumination
inline control system (ICS3), a Smart Vision Lights Brick light, or a similar
device). This signal does not provide power; instead, it provides analog intensity
(dimming) control (0-10 V translates to 0-100% illumination).
- Timers.1 exposure, 1 strobe, 8 general purpose.
❯ 1 exposure timer. A 28-bit timer used to control the exposure of your Zebra 
Iris GTX, and allows a range of exposure time from 50 usec to 4 sec. The
timer output will always set camera exposure, but can be simultaneously
redirected to any auxiliary output signal.
❯ 1 strobe timer. A 28-bit timer whose output can be routed to any auxiliary
output signal. The resulting output signal can then be used to control a strobe
device. This timer is limited by the maximum possible value for the exposure
timer, and when the exposure timer ends, so will the strobe timer.
❯ 8 general timers. Each of the timers (Timer 1 through 8) is a 32-bit timer
and can count up to 4,294,967,295 clock ticks before resetting. Each timer
can use a specified clock source for its active period and a different specified
clock source for its delay period.
- One I/O command list. Used to schedule I/O commands, in any order.
- One rotary decoder. Supports input from rotary encoders with quadrature
output.

Zebra  Imaging operating system utilities
Zebra  Iris GTX includes several useful utilities. They are available from the
following web address:
http:\\GTXxxxxxx:8080
In the above example, replace xxxxxx with the six digits of your smart camera’s
MAC address. If you have changed the camera’s device name, replace GTXxxxxxx
with the name of your smart camera, or use its IP address; for more information,
see Connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX desktop section, in Chapter 2: Powering and
connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX.
Note that these utilities are stored on your Zebra  Iris GTX, but should be
installed on your development computer, in case the operating system partition
becomes corrupt and you need to use these programs. They can be downloaded
from your Zebra  Iris GTX’s web address, shown at the top of this section.
The utilities offered are as follows:
(cid:129) Virtual network computing (VNC). This utility allow you to remotely connect
to your Zebra  Iris GTX.
(cid:129) Zebra  System Discovery (MtxSysDiscovery) utility. This 64-bit Windows
utility allows you to discover Zebra  Iris GTX cameras on your network. In
addition, it can change network settings, restart or shut down individual smart
cameras, or open the portal page of a specific camera. On computers with Zebra 
Design Assistant installed, this utility is included in the Tools folder, accessible
from the MIL Control Center.
(cid:129) Bonjour browser. This is a link to the Internet that leads to the Bonjour browser
website. Bonjour browser is a program that lists all the services on your subnet.
This provides a way to find the IP address of any Zebra  Iris GTX on the subnet.

Upgrading the Zebra  Imaging operating system 75
(cid:129) FileZilla. A client utility for transferring files from one computer to another using
FTP, FTPS, or SFTP.
(cid:129) Putty. A client console utility for running remote sessions on a computer over a
network using the SSH (Secure Shell), Telnet, or Rlogin network protocols.
(cid:129) Rufus. A utility that formats and creates bootable USB keys.
Upgrading the Zebra  Imaging operating
system
If you have upgraded Zebra  Design Assistant, you might be required to update
the version of the Zebra  Imaging operating system (MIOS) on Zebra  Iris GTX.
You can configure the MILConfig utility on your development computer to
receive updates. You can then use this update to upgrade the camera.
Warning An upgrade will erase all information on the Zebra  Iris GTX storage drive. If
you have made changes to a deployed project from its operator view, it is
recommended that in Zebra  Design Assistant, you synchronize recipes between
the runtime and the design time project. Also, import all recipes that you created
at runtime, copy all image folders that are stored on Zebra  Iris GTX, and back
up any validation sets that you need to continue using after the upgrade.
To upgrade the Zebra  Imaging operating system (MIOS) on your Zebra 
Iris GTX, perform the following:
1. Connect remotely to your Zebra  Iris GTX from Zebra  Design Assistant.
Zebra  Design Assistant will detect a version mismatch and prompt you to
upgrade. When you accept this prompt, an Update dialog will appear.
2. In the Update dialog, browse to the location on your development computer
where MILConfig stored the new MIOS ISO file (.iso). This is generally in the
same location as where your Zebra  Design Assistant upgrade package is stored.
3. Once the MIOS ISO file has been selected, click on the Update button in the
Update dialog and your update will begin.
The ISO file will be copied to Zebra  Iris GTX; then, the camera will power cycle.
Upon power cycling, the camera is upgraded.

Page 76
76 Appendix C: Zebra  Imaging operating system utilities and recovery
To apply an MIOS upgrade on several smart cameras, it might be more efficient
to upgrade from a USB key, connected to the smart camera’s VGA/USB connector,
through a GTR-CBL-VGAUSB cable. To do so, you will need to install the MIOS
upgrade on one smart camera, back it up on a USB key, and then deploy it on the
other smart cameras. See the Making a backup MIOS and deploying it on multiple
units section, later in this appendix.
Restoring the Zebra  Imaging operating
system to factory defaults
If required, you can restore the Zebra  Imaging operating system to the factory
default using the MIOS ISO stored in the recovery partition on your Zebra 
Iris GTX, or you can restore it from a USB key with a factory default MIOS ISO.
Restoring the factory default MIOS
The factory default version of the MIOS ISO is stored on the Zebra  Iris GTX
recovery partition. To recover the factory default version, perform the following:
1. Connect a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to your Zebra  Iris GTX, as described
in Chapter 2: Powering and connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX.
2. Reboot your Zebra  Iris GTX.

Making a backup MIOS and deploying it on
multiple units
If you have updated settings or made specific changes to your MIOS that you
would like to use on other units, you will need to make a backup MIOS ISO.
This backup is stored in the recovery partition of Zebra  Iris GTX. This MIOS
ISO cannot be mounted onto a USB key; it can only be stored on one.
Alternatively, you can store this backup on your network. Once a backup is saved,
it can be deployed on a unit by following the instructions outlined in the
subsections below.
Saving a backup MIOS
To create a backup MIOS ISO that you can use in the event that your drive ever
corrupts, you should store it on a blank USB key with a capacity of 4 Gbytes, or
more. To do so:
1. Follow steps 1-4 of the Restoring the factory default MIOS section earlier in this
appendix.
2. On the Zebra  Imaging OS - Recovery page, select Backup System Disk.
A terminal will open and start the process of creating a backup MIOS ISO. The
ISO file will be stored in the boot/backup/rescue folder of your
Zebra  Iris GTX unit.

network.
Deploying a backup MIOS to the same unit on which it was created
Once you have made a backup MIOS ISO, you can now deploy this backup if
you need to restore the unit. To deploy the backup MIOS ISO, perform the
following:
1. Reboot your Zebra  Iris GTX.
2. Near the end of the BIOS boot process, after the BIOS logo appears, a
monochrome screen presents you with three options, instead of two: load the
current MIOS, load the recovery ISO, or load the backup ISO. Use your keyboard
to select the latter.

selection on the monochrome screen; eventually, the unit will present the login
screen, ask for the default password, and then present the Zebra  Imaging OS -
Backup page. To complete the deployment of the backup on the system disk, select
the Install to system disk option.
Deploying a backup MIOS to a different unit
With a backup MIOS ISO saved either on a USB key or somewhere on your
network, you can deploy the backup MIOS ISO to multiple units that require the
same settings as the backup MIOS ISO. To deploy the backup MIOS ISO to
multiple units, perform the following:
1. Locate the backup MIOS ISO and copy it to a known location on the Zebra 
Iris GTX unit that you will be restoring.
2. Open the Linux command terminal and use setrescue.sh backup to install the
backup MIOS ISO onto the recovery partition.
3. Reboot the Zebra  Iris GTX unit.

Updating the Zebra  Iris GTX BIOS 91
Updating the Zebra  Iris GTX BIOS
After upgrading the operating system, you should verify that you have the most
up-to-date BIOS version before beginning.
Important If you do not have the correct BIOS version, it will cause a problem with your
Zebra  Iris GTX. The BIOS version is displayed on the Essential Information
page of the Zebra  Design Assistant configuration portal; on this page, you can
also see if there are new BIOS versions available.
Updating the BIOS is a delicate operation that requires user-intervention to ensure
it is executed without interruption. Note that if a power failure occurs during the
BIOS update process, your Zebra  Iris GTX will have to be sent to Zebra  for
repair.
To update the BIOS, perform the following:
1. Access the Zebra  Iris GTX desktop. To do so, you can either:
(cid:129) Connect directly using a local display and mouse-keyboard connection. To
connect a local display, mouse, and keyboard, see the Powering and connecting
to your Zebra  Iris GTX section, in Chapter 2: Powering and connecting to your
Zebra  Iris GTX.
(cid:129) Connect remotely via a VNC client, Putty, or through Microsoft Windows
telnet. To find a VCN client or Putty, follow the instructions in the Zebra 
Imaging operating system utilities section, earlier in this appendix.
2. If you are connecting with a VNC client, once the Zebra  Iris GTX desktop is
displayed, open a terminal window by clicking on the Activities menu command
and then the Terminal icon. When using Putty, you are presented immediately
with the terminal window.
Note that you must have Auto logon enabled in the Zebra  Design Assistant portal
in order to connect to a VNC client. This is found on the AUTO LOGON tab
of the DEVICE portal page. See the Zebra  Design Assistant documentation for
more information.

3. Inside the terminal window, go to the /opt/BIOS folder using the following
commands:
cd /opt
cd BIOS
 Note that MIOS is case-sensitive.
4. Start the BIOS update application using the following command:
sudo ./IRISGTX_<BIOSVERSION>.bin
where you should replace <BIOSVERSION> with the new BIOS version (for
example, IrisGTX_100002.bin). The BIOS update starts after a 10-second delay.
Once the BIOS update begins, information will appear on your local display.
5. When the BIOS update completes, you will be prompted to reboot Zebra 
Iris GTX. Changes made will not take effect until you reboot.

Content: Abstract
Artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning by way of deep learning, is having a tremendous beneficial impact on the world at large. Deep learning technology is used in a myriad of applications, from giving virtual assistants the ability to process natural language, to enhancing the e-commerce  experience through recommendation engines, to assisting medical practitioners with computer-aided diagnosis, to performing predictive maintenance in the aerospace industry. Deep learning technology is also a key enabler of Industry 4.0—the fourth industrial revolution that has occurred in manufacturing, specifically with the use of smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine learning—where machine vision technology is an important contributor. Crucial to note is that deep learning alone is not capable of tackling all manners of machine vision tasks, and requires careful preparation and upkeep to be truly effective. This white paper will detail how machine vision—the automated computerized process of acquiring and analyzing digital images primarily for ensuring quality, tracking, and guiding production—benefits from deep learning as the latter is making the former more accessible and capable.

BRAKE DISK MANUFACTURER REFINES QUALITY
ASSESSMENT WITH VISION SYSTEM
Zebra Design Assistant X vision software optimizes quality
assurance verification with highly efficient algorithms
MO.S.A.I.C is a global team specialized in robotics and industrial automation; with offices in Italy, Brazil, Germany,
and Serbia, their engineers have focused on the design, construction, and maintenance of vision systems for
sectors including automotive, food & beverage, paper, logistics, and pharmaceutical production since 2014.
A key inspection system in their automotive vertical conducts surface quality inspections on car and truck brake
disks. Though the system had been running effectively with objective human assessment, MOSAIC sought an
enhanced quality-control solution to exclude bad units more reliably and effectively from the production line.
®
Their team evaluated several options, and decided upon Zebra Imaging’s software and components, largely
“because of the excellent technical support, software features, performance, and great price-to-quality ratio their
products afford,” affirms Marco Pistilli, IT engineer, machine-vision system and software developer with MOSAIC.
The highest quality assurance is integral to the production of brake disks, which are made through a sand-casting
process, a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material. After the sand-casting
process, disks are cleaned of sand inside a big cleaning drum. Sometimes, the cleaning process is not optimal
and sandy residue remains. MOSAIC’s system checks for sand and sintering traces on the disk surface, removing
bad or non-optimal units from the production line. Sand and sintering debris can damage the machining tool or
reduce its life cycle in further production steps.

The sand-casting process complete, a finished brake disk undergoes a scan to check that the surface is free of particulate traces. The
custom-built lighting system optimizes visibility for the image acquisition.
“With human inspectors, it is natural that product samples, especially those close to the limit between good and bad,
will be assessed differently by different operators. The likelihood of these differences increases after humans have
worked a few hours and are tired,” notes Pistilli, “but with a vision system, in addition to the enhanced quality control,
the inspections are repeatable 24 hours a day and the machines perform faster than any operator could.”
With the new Zebra Imaging-based vision system, quality control inspection occurs faster and with greater accuracy and repeatability
than with the prior manual inspection process. The result? Fewer non-optimal brake disks passing through the inspection process.

PERFECTION UNDER PRESSURE
From start to finish, the production process for brake disks encompasses the sand-casting phase, sand removal and
disk separation, cleaning/blasting, machine-vision quality inspection, and finally, the disk machining phase.
Three people from MOSAIC participated in developing the machine vision project: Luciano Cecchi, a senior expert
engineer responsible for the machine design and optical calculation; Pistilli, who oversaw hardware selection/setup
and software development; and Alessandro Viola, a programmable logic controller (PLC) expert programmer for
the PLC hardware selection and software logic development. “We had great support from Luca Gallo, our contact
at Zebra Imaging,” Pistilli confirms. “I also had the chance to learn new skills by following Zebra Vision Academy
training, which has proven of tremendous benefit.”
To ensure the highest quality standards, the custom vision system was developed and tuned to highlight subtle
defects that only experienced quality inspection workers would notice, defects that would be invisible to the naked
eye. “Challenges are our strength,” smiles Pistilli. “We do what other companies do not want to do because of risks
®
and uncertainty of results. We like challenges.” MOSAIC selected flowchart-based Zebra Design Assistant X vision
software because of its effectiveness, precision, and rapid response.
® ™
Zebra Design Assistant X software runs on an HP workstation equipped with an Intel Core i9 processor and
three Zebra Concord PoE frame grabbers, which acquire and process the images coming from nine Teledyne
DALSA cameras—seven Genie Nanos and two line scan models. A custom-built lighting system uses MidOpt filters
on camera lenses and spotlights. The vision system interacts with a PLC via fast-scan modules and an encoder;
hardware triggers come directly from the PLC.
Every camera has a different shooting position; images are captured while the disks pass through the inspection
tunnel on the moving production line. As the system comprises multiple cameras, Pistilli notes, “Zebra Design
Assistant X is the right tool because of its ability to spread the load over the available CPU cores, and the possibility to
synchronize all elements of the systems with ease. Moreover, this flowchart-based software allowed our developers
to focus more on achieving our desired accuracy and performance, and the algorithm logic, instead of worrying
about coding.”
One of the nine cameras integrated into the vision system. Image sensors are more responsive to lower wavelengths or blue-purple
light, which accounts for the unique purple tone of the image. Working with purple light best brought out the defects, allowing the
MOSAIC team to shorten the exposure and thus speed up the vision inspection.

SMOOTHING THE EDGES
To achieve their quality-assurance metrics, the team at MOSAIC spent several months testing lighting/camera
setups and optimal geometrical constraint combinations. Three challenges were of key consideration.
First, MOSAIC wanted to inspect every angle of the disk surface without stopping the production line or needing to
invert or rotate each disk as it passed. The short cycle time made physical displacement of the disk an encumbrance
to the process, and thus something avoidable through use of multiple cameras. Integrating nine different cameras
to catch every disk angle helped address this concern.

The MOSAIC team also wished to conduct quality assurance for more than 200 different disk models using, ideally,
the same vision setup. “We overcame these challenges by developing an effective background removal algorithm
to process all the disk models with the same logic and processing algorithm. With this capability, there is no need
to redefine regions of interest,” Pistilli reports. “Zebra Design Assistant X let us create efficient algorithms for
analysis, too, implementing loops and reconfiguring steps dynamically to obtain the best performance results.”
Finally, performing image acquisition with absolute precision was central to the system development. Using the
convenient Operator View facility in Zebra Design Assistant X, the operator manages recipes and creates different sets
of parameters for each camera on the line. Operators can customize the image color-map to best match their needs.
A filmstrip allows to recall previous pictures and relative datasets for further analysis. A dataset is generated for each
analysis for further investigation from quality-assurance department. “The user interface is so easy to use, it’s like using
a tablet because of the wide touch screen,” says Pistilli. “The MOSAIC team leveraged the industrial communication
tools and implemented fast-scan PLC hardware plus an encoder to get perfectly timed shots,” affirms Viola.
Zebra Design Assistant X let us create efficient
algorithms for analysis, too, implementing loops and
reconfiguring steps dynamically to obtain the best
performance results.
The Operator View created within Zebra Design Assistant X streamlines management of recipes and parameters, with a user-
friendly touch-screen interface. The filmstrip format makes it easy to retrieve previously acquired images and datasets; a dataset
is generated for each analysis for quality-control investigation purposes.

CONCLUSION
With the new brake disk quality inspection system up and running, the MOSAIC team has started working on a similar
project for pharmaceutical laboratory machine automation. Thanks in in part to the successful implementation of this
automotive vision system, they are exploring building the system on Zebra Imaging hardware and software.
Zebra Design Assistant X software allows us to quickly deploy feasibility studies and application demos within
“the
production software. The completeness of its tools helps us to work on both 2D and 3D systems,” Pistilli
concludes. “Truly, Zebra Design Assistant X offers us all we need to deploy an effective machine-vision system.

Field-Proven Vision Tools
Image analysis and processing tools
Central to MIL X are tools for calibrating; classifying, enhancing,
and transforming images; locating objects; extracting and measuring
features; reading character strings; and decoding and verifying
identification marks. These tools are carefully developed to provide
outstanding performance and reliability, and can be used within a sin-
gle computer system or distributed across several computer systems.
Pattern recognition tools
MIL X includes two tools for performing pattern recognition: Pattern
Matching and Geometric Model Finder (GMF). These tools are
primarily used to locate complex objects for guiding a gantry, stage,
or robot, or for directing subsequent measurement operations.
The Pattern Matching tool is based on normalized grayscale correlation
(NGC), a classical technique that finds a pattern by looking for a similar
Pattern Matching
spatial distribution of intensity. A hierarchical search strategy lets
this tool very quickly and reliably locate a pattern, including multiple
occurrences, which are translated and slightly rotated, with sub-
pixel accuracy. The tool performs well when scene lighting changes
uniformly, which is useful for dealing with attenuating illumination.
A pattern can be trained manually or determined automatically for
alignment. Search parameters can be manually adjusted and patterns
can be manually edited to tailor performance.
The GMF tool uses geometric features (e.g., contours) to find an object.
The tool quickly and reliably finds multiple models—including multiple
occurrences—that are translated, rotated, and/or scaled with sub-pixel
accuracy. GMF locates an object that is partially missing and continues
to perform when a scene is subject to uneven changes in illumination,
thus relaxing lighting requirements. A model can be trained manually
from an image, obtained from a CAD file, or determined automatically
for alignment. A model can also be obtained from the Edge Finder tool,
where the geometric features are defined by color boundaries and
crests or ridges in addition to contours. Physical setup requirements
are eased when GMF is used in conjunction with the Calibration tool
as models become independent of camera position. GMF parameters
can be manually adjusted and models can be manually edited to tailor
Geometric Model Finder
performance.

Shape finding tools
The GMF tool in MIL X includes dedicated modes for finding circles,
ellipses, rectangles, and line segments. These modes use the same
advanced edge-based technique to locate one or more occurrences
of any size—including ones within another for circles, ellipses, and
rectangles. Circle finding is defined by the anticipated radius, the
possible scale range, and the number of expected occurrences. Ellipse
and rectangle finding are defined by the anticipated width and height,
the possible scale and aspect ratio ranges, and the number of expected
occurrences. Line segment finding is defined by the anticipated length
and the number of expected occurrences. Continuous and broken edges
lying within an adjustable variation tolerance produce the requested
shape.
The shape-finding tool returns the total number of found occurrences;
Circle Finder
for each occurrence, the tool provides the center position and score
relative to the reference. It also gives the radius and scale for circles;
the angle, aspect ratio, width, and scale for ellipses and rectangles;
and the start and end positions as well as the length for line segments.
These specialized modes are generally faster and more robust at finding
the specific shapes than generic pattern recognition.

Feature extraction and analysis tools
MIL X provides a choice of tools for image analysis: Blob Analysis
and Edge Finder. These tools are used to identify and measure basic
features for determining object presence and location, and to further
examine objects.
The Blob Analysis tool works on segmented binary images, where
objects are previously separated from the background and one another.
The tool—using run-length encoding—quickly identifies blobs and can
measure over 50 binary and grayscale characteristics. Measurements
Blob Analysis
can be used to sort and select blobs. The tool also reconstructs and
merges blobs, which is useful when working with blobs that straddle
successive images.
The Edge Finder tool is well suited for scenes with changing, uneven
illumination. The tool—using gradient-based and Hessian-based
approaches—quickly identifies contours, as well as crests or ridges, in
monochrome or color images and can measure over 50 characteristics
with sub-pixel accuracy. Measurements can be used to sort and select
edges. The edge extraction method can be adjusted to tailor performance.

Classification tools
MIL X includes Classification tools for automatically categorizing image
content or previously extracted features using machine learning.
Image-oriented classification makes use of deep learning technology—
specifically the convolutional neural network (CNN) and variants—in
two distinct approaches.
The global approach assigns images or image regions to pre-established
classes. It lends itself to identification tasks where the goal is to
distinguish between similarly looking objects including those with
slight imperfections. The results for each image or image region consist
of the most likely class and a score for each class.
The segmentation approach generates maps indicating the pre-
established class and score for all image pixels. It is appropriate for
Image-oriented classification (global approach)
detection tasks where the objective is to determine the incidence,
location, and extent of flaws or features. These features can then be
further analyzed and measured using traditional tools like Blob Analysis.
Image-oriented classification is particularly well-suited for inspecting
images of highly textured, naturally varying, and acceptably deformed
goods in complex and varying scenes.
Users can opt to train a deep neural network on their own or commission
Zebra Imaging to do so using previously collected images; these images
must be both adequate in number and representative of the expected
application conditions. Different types of training are supported, such as
transfer learning and fine-tuning, all starting from one of the supplied pre-
defined deep neural network architectures. MIL X provides the necessary
infrastructure and interactive environment for building the required
training dataset—including the labeling of images and augmenting the
Image-oriented classification (segmentation approach)
dataset with synthesized images—as well as monitoring and analyzing the
training process. MIL X can hide the associated intricacies by automatically
subdividing the training dataset, offering preset augmentations, and
proposing a neural network model to start with. Training is accomplished
using a NVIDIA GPU4,5 or x64-based CPU. Inference is performed on a
CPU, avoiding the need for specialized GPU hardware. Alternately, users
can import a trained and compatible neural network model stored in the
popular ONNX format.
Feature-oriented classification uses a tree ensemble technique to
categorize objects of interest from their features, expressed in numerical
form, obtained from prior analysis using tools like Blob Analysis. The
categorization is made by majority voting of the individual-feature
decision trees. As with image-oriented classification, users can train
a tree ensemble on their own using the facilities provided in MIL X or
employ Zebra Imaging for the task.

1D and 2D measurement tools
MIL X offers three tools for measuring: Measurement, Bead inspection,
and Metrology. These tools are predominantly used to assess
manufacturing quality.
The Measurement tool uses the projection of image intensity to very
quickly locate and measure straight edges, stripes, or circles within
a carefully defined rectangular region. The tool can make several 1D
measurements on edges, stripes, and circles, as well as between edges,
stripes, and circles.
The Bead inspection tool is for inspecting material that is applied as
a continuous sinuous bead, such as adhesives and sealants, or the
Measurement
channel where the bead will be applied. The tool identifies discrepancies
in length, placement, and width, as well as discontinuities. The Bead
inspection tool works by accepting a user-defined coarse path as a list
of points on a reference bead and then automatically and optimally
placing search boxes to form a template. The size and spacing of these
search boxes can be modified to change the sampling resolution. The
allowable bead width, offset, gap, and overall acceptance measure can
be adjusted to meet specific inspection criteria.
The Metrology tool is intended for 2D Geometric Dimensioning and
Tolerancing (GD&T) applications. The tool quickly extracts edges within
defined regions to best fit geometric features. It also supports the
construction of geometric features derived from measured ones or
defined mathematically. Geometric features include arcs, circles, points,
and segments. The tool validates tolerances based on the dimensions, Bead inspection
positions, and shapes of geometric features. The tool’s effectiveness
is maintained when subject to uneven changes in scene illumination,
which relaxes lighting requirements. The expected measured and
constructed geometric features, along with the tolerances, are kept
together in a template, which is easily repositioned using the results
of other locating tools. The Metrology tool— along with the use of
the Calibration tool—enables templates to be independent of camera
position; it can also work on a 3D profile or cross-section image.

Color analysis tools
MIL X includes tools to help identify parts, products, and items
using color, assessing quality from color as well as isolating
features using color. The Color Distance tool reveals the extent
of color differences within and between images. The Color
Projection tool separates features from an image based on
their colors and can also be used to enhance color to grayscale
conversion for subsequent analysis using other grayscale tools.
The Color Matching tool determines the best matching color from
Color Projection
a collection of samples for each region of interest within an image.
A color sample can be specified either interactively from an
image—with the ability to mask out undesired colors—or using
numerical values. A color sample can be a single color or a
distribution of colors (i.e., histogram). The color-matching method
and the interpretation of color differences can be manually
adjusted to suit application requirements. The Color Matching tool
can also match each image pixel to color samples to segment the
image into appropriate elements for further analysis using other
tools.
Color Matching
MIL X includes color-relative calibration to correct color appea-
rance due to differences in lighting and image sensing, thus
enabling consistent performance over time and across systems.
Three methods are provided: Histogram-based, sample-to-
sample, and global mean variance. The first method is unsupervised,
only requiring that the reference and training images have similar
contents. The second method is semi-supervised, requiring the
correspondence between color samples on reference and training
images, typically of a color chart. The third method is best suited for
dealing with color drift and relies on global color distribution.

Character recognition tools
MIL X provides three tools for character recognition: SureDotOCR,
String Reader, and OCR. These tools combine to read text that is
engraved, etched, marked, printed, punched, or stamped on surfaces.
The SureDotOCR tool is uniquely designed for the specific challenge
of reading dot-matrix text produced by inkjet printers and dot peen
markers. Its use is straightforward—users simply need to specify the
dot size and the dimension, but not the location, of the text region. The
tool reads text of variable length4, at any angle, with varying contrast,
SureDotOCR
and/or on an uneven background. It interprets distorted and touching
characters as well as characters of varying scale. It also accepts
constituent dots that are of varying size and touching each other4. The
tool recognizes punctuation marks and blank spaces. It supports the
creation and editing of character fonts while including pre-defined fonts.
The tool automatically handles multiple lines of text where each line can
utilize a different font. The ability to set user-defined constraints, overall
and at specific character positions, further enhances recognition rates.
The SureDotOCR tool provides greater robustness and flexibility than
case-specific techniques that convert dot-matrix characters into solid
ones for reading with traditional character recognition tools.
The String Reader tool is based on a sophisticated technique that uses
geometric features to quickly locate and read text made up of solid
characters in images where these characters are well separated from
the background and from one another. The tool handles text strings
with a known or unknown number of evenly or proportionally spaced
characters. It accommodates changes in character angle with respect
to the string, aspect ratio, scale, and skew, as well as contrast reversal.
Strings can be located across multiple lines and at a slight angle. The
tool reads from multiple pre-defined TrueType™ and Postscript™)
or user-defined Latin-based fonts. Also included are ready-made
Latin-based unified contexts for automatic number plate recognition
(ANPR) and machine print. In addition, strings can be subject to
user-defined constraints, overall and at specific character positions,
to further increase recognition rates. The tool is designed for ease-of-
use and includes String Expert, a utility to help fine-tune settings and
String Reader
troubleshoot poor results.
The OCR tool utilizes a template-matching method to quickly read text
with a known number of evenly spaced characters. Once calibrated, the
tool reliably reads text strings with a consistent character size even if
the strings themselves are at an angle. Characters can come from one
of the provided OCR-A, OCR-B, MICR CMC-7, MICR E-13B, SEMI M12-92,
and SEMI M13-88 fonts or a user-defined font. Strings can be subject to
user-defined constraints, overall and at specific character positions, to
OCR
further increase recognition rates.

1D and 2D code reading and verification tool
MIL X offers Code Reader, a fast and dependable tool for locating and
reading 1D, 2D, and composite identification marks. The tool handles
rotated, scaled, and degraded codes in tough lighting conditions. It
simultaneously reads multiple 1D or DataMatrix codes as well as
small codes found in complex scenes. It can automatically determine
a 1D code type and the optimal settings from a training set. The tool
can return the orientation, position, and size of a code. In addition to
reading, the tool can also be used to verify the quality of a code based
on the ANSI/AIM and ISO/IEC grading standards in conjunction with
the proper hardware setup.

Registration tools
MIL X has a tool set for handling the registration or fusion of images
for various objectives. A Stitching tool is available for transforming
images taken from different vantage points into a unified scene, which
would be impractical or impossible to achieve using a single camera.
It can also align an image to a reference for subsequent inspection.
The tool contends with not only translation, but also with perspective,
including scale. Alignment to a reference image or to neighboring
images is performed with sub-pixel accuracy and is robust to local
changes in contrast and intensity. In addition, the tool can be used
for super-resolution where a sharper image is created from a series
of images taken from roughly the same vantage point, which is useful
for dealing with movement such as mechanical vibration.
Registration (Stitching)
Separate extended Depth-of-field and Depth-from-focus tools are
on hand to produce, respectively, a single all-in-focus image and an
index image from a series of images of a motionless scene taken at
different focus points. The index image can subsequently be used to
infer depth.
A Photometric Stereo tool is offered to produce an image that
emphasizes surface irregularities—such as embossed or engraved
features, scratches, or indentations. The image is produced from a
series of images of the same scene taken with directional illumination
as driven by a Quad (X2) Controller from Advanced Illumination (Ai),
Light Sequence Switch (LSS) from CCS, a LED Light Manager (LLM) from
Smart Vision Lights, or similar light controller.
An HDR imaging tool is also available to combine images of an identical
Registration (Depth-from-focus)
scene, taken at different camera exposure levels, into a single image
that contains a greater range of luminance.

2D calibration tool
Calibration is a routine requirement for imaging. MIL X includes a 2D
Calibration tool to convert results (i.e., positions and measurements)
from pixel to real-world units and vice-versa. The tool can compensate
results, and even an image itself, for camera lens and perspective
distortions. Calibration is achieved using an image of a grid or
chessboard target, or just a list of known points. Calibration can be
achieved from a partially visible target. MIL X also supports encoded
targets that relay target characteristics—including coordinate system
origin and axes—to further automate the calibration process.
Image processing primitives tools
A professional imaging toolkit must include a complete set of
operators for enhancing and transforming images, and for retrieving
statistics in preparation for ensuing analysis. MIL X includes an
2D Calibration
extensive list of Image Processing tools with fast operators for
arithmetic, Bayer interpolation, color space conversion, spatial
and temporal filtering, geometric transformations, histogram, logic,
lookup table (LUT) mapping, morphology, orientation, projection,

Field-Proven Vision Tools
Image compression and video encoding tool
MIL X provides Image Compression and Video Encoding tools for
optimizing storage and transmission requirements. Lossy and
lossless JPEG and JPEG2000 image compression and H.264 video
encoding are supported. H.264 support can leverage Intel Quick
Sync Video technology for encoding multiple high-definition video
streams in real-time. MIL X saves and loads compressed images
individually using the JPG and JP2 file formats or as a sequence
using the AVI file format. The H.264 elementary stream can be
stored in and recovered from a MP4 format file. Compression and
encoding settings can be adjusted for different size versus quality.
Tools fully optimized for speed
MIL X image processing and analysis operations are optimized by
Zebra Imaging to take full advantage of Intel SIMD instructions—
including AVX2 and AVX-5124—as well as multi-core CPU
and multi-CPU system architectures, to perform at top speed.
MIL X automatically dispatches operations across the number
of processor cores needed to achieve maximum performance.
Alternatively, it gives programmers control over the number of
processor cores assigned to perform a given operation.
In addition, MIL X is able to offload from the host CPU and even
accelerate certain image processing operations when used with
Zebra Imaging processing hardware with FPGA technology.

3D Vision Tools
Situations sometime arise where classical 2D vision techniques are
unable to perform the required localization, recognition, inspection,
or measurement tasks. These circumstances range from an inability
to obtain the necessary consistent contrast from conventional
illumination to needing the pose of an object with six degrees of
freedom. This is where 3D vision tools step in—whether alone or in
combination with 2D vision tools—to carry out the job.
MIL X has a rich set of tools for performing 3D processing and
analysis. These tools work on the 3D data produced by profile
and snapshot sensors as well as stereo and time-of-flight (ToF)
Point-cloud (meshed) filtering
cameras. Consult the Camera Interfacing section on the Zebra
Imaging website for a list of qualified makes. The 3D data supported
by MIL X can also come from a Stanford Polygon Format (PLY) or
stereolithography (STL) file.
3D processing tools
The 3D processing tools in MIL X operate on—and in between—point
clouds, depth maps, and/or elementary objects. The latter can be a
box, cylinder, line, plane, or sphere. Operations on a point cloud include
filtering (denoising)4, rotation, scaling, translation, cropping/masking,
re-sampling, and meshing into surfaces; computing normal vectors; Pattern Recognition on depth map
projecting to a depth map; and extracting a cross-section. Operations
on a depth map include addition, subtraction/distance, and minimum/
maximum; filling gaps (i.e., caused by invalid or missing data); and
extracting a profile. Additional operations on both a point cloud
and depth map include establishing a bounding box, computing the
centroid, counting the number of points, and calculating the distances
to the nearest neighboring point.
A depth map can subsequently be analyzed using MIL X’s 2D vision
Character Recognition on depth map
tools like Pattern Recognition—without being affected by illumination
variations or surface texture—and Character Recognition, when the

3D Vision Tools
3D shape finding tool
MIL X provides a tool for locating one or more cylindrical or
spherical shapes in a point cloud. The shape to find is specified
either numerically or from a previously defined elementary object.
The search process is defined by the number of occurrences to find,
radius range, length span (for cylinders), maximum model coverage,
acceptance (minimum score), and certainty (sure score), as well as the
fit and reserve point distances. A find operation yields the number of
occurrences found and the maximum fit distance; for each occurrence,
the tool produces the score, error, number of points, center, and
radius. For cylindrical shapes, it also returns the length, central axis,
and bases.
3D blob analysis tool
The 3D Blob Analysis tool in MIL X is available to locate and inspect
Cylinder Finder
objects in a point cloud. It makes it possible to segment a point cloud
into blobs, calculate numerous blob features, filter and sort blobs by
features, as well as select and combine blobs. Multiple segmentation
methods can be selected: point distance, color distance, or similarity
of normal vectors.

3D Vision Tools
3D metrology tools
MIL X includes a toolset for 3D Metrology. Within this toolset, one tool
fits a point cloud or depth map to a cylinder, line, plane, or sphere.
Additional tools compute various distances and statistics between
point clouds, depth maps, and fitted or user-defined elementary
objects. Another tool is available to determine volume in a variety of
ways.
3D registration tool
An additional 3D Registration tool in MIL X establishes the fine
alignment of two or more point clouds and merges them together
if required. This tool provides the means to perform high-accuracy
comparative analysis between a 3D model and target, do full object
reconstruction from multiple neighboring 3D scans, and align the data
from multiple 3D camera or sensors.
3D Metrology
3D profilometry tools
MIL X also contains tools for 3D Profilometry using a discrete sheet-
of-light source (i.e., laser) and a conventional 2D camera. A calculator
is included to establish the camera, lens, and alignment needed
to achieve the desired measurement resolution and range. MIL X
provides straightforward calibration methods and associated tools
to produce a point cloud or depth map. The calibration carried out
in MIL X can combine multiple sheet-of-light sources and 2D camera
pairs to work as one, thus avoiding the need for post alignment and
3D alignment for comparative analysis: Model, target, and difference
merger. Such configurations are useful to limit occlusion, increase
scan density, and image the whole volume of an object. Moreover,
MIL X makes use of a unique derivative-based algorithm for beam
extraction or peak detection, which is both more accurate and robust
than traditional ones based on the center of gravity.
3D calibration tools
In addition, MIL X provides the necessary calibration services to
position and orient a camera or sensor in 3D space and determine the
coordinate transformation matrices between it and the rest of a robotic
cell. The camera or sensor can either be fixed overhead and/or to the
side of the robotic cell (i.e., eye-to-hand calibration) or mounted at
the end of the robot arm (i.e., eye-in-hand calibration). The calibration
enables to relate what a camera or sensor sees—the object pose
established using other analysis MIL X tools—to a robot controller for
guidance.

Development Features
Complete application development environment
In addition to image processing, analysis, and archiving tools, MIL X
includes image capture, annotation, and display functions, which form
a cohesive API. The API and accompanying utilities are recognized
by the large installed base of users for facilitating and accelerating
application development.
Portable API
The MIL X C/C++ API is not only intuitive and straightforward to
use but it is also portable. It allows applications to be easily moved
from one supported video interface or operating system to another,
providing platform flexibility and protecting the original development
investment.
.NET development
Included in MIL X is a low-overhead API layer for developing Windows
applications using .NET written in managed Visual Basic and Visual
C# code. MIL X configuration and diagnostic tool
JIT compilation and scripting
MIL X supports C# and Visual Basic JIT compilation and CPython
scripting, facilitating experimentation and prototyping. Such code can
even be executed from within a compiled MIL X-based application,
providing a simpler way to tailor an already-deployed application.
Simplified platform management
With MIL X, a developer does not require in-depth knowledge of the
underlying platform. MIL X is designed to deal with the specifics of
each platform and provide simplified management (e.g., hardware
detection, initialization, and buffer copy). MIL X gives developers direct
access to certain platform resources such as the physical address
of a buffer. The software also includes debugging services (e.g.,
function parameter checking, tracing, and error reporting), as well as
configuration and diagnostic tools.
Designed for multi-tasking
MIL X supports multi-processing and multi-tasking programming
models, namely, multiple MIL X applications not sharing MIL X data or
a single MIL X application with multiple threads sharing MIL X data.
It provides mechanisms to access shared MIL X data and ensure that
multiple threads using the same MIL X resources do not interfere
with each other. MIL X also offers platform-independent thread
management for enhancing application portability.

supports image-acquisition boards for all major interfaces—whether
analog, Camera Link®, CoaXPress®, DisplayPort™, DVI, GigE Vision®,
HDMI™, and SDI—as well as image processing offload using a field-
programmable gate array (FPGA). Users can combine the required Zebra Supersight PCIe Gen3 backplane
boards to build a robust, flexible platform for intensive image capture
and processing tasks.
Consistent long-term availability
Carefully selected components, coupled with strict change control,
ensures consistent long-term supply of the Zebra Supersight. This
allows OEMs to maximize return on the original investment without
incurring additional costs associated with repeated validation of
constantly changing mainstream commercial platforms.
Switched fabric backplane
A unique PCIe Gen3, multi-segmented backplane provides the switched
fabric to configure acquisition and processing elements in either one,
two, or four computing clusters. The uniqueness of this backplane is
that add-in cards can be plugged into any slot and still be assigned to an
SHB, even if the card is in a different segment. With 11 PCIe Gen3 slots
available, the backplane provides excellent expansion opportunities for
Zebra Imaging and third-party video capture, accelerator/co-proces-
sor, graphics, and general I/O boards to fulfill the needs of demanding
imaging applications.

Value proposition
Zebra AltiZ offers the most elegant solution possible for combating the occlusion effect often encountered when using common
3D profile sensors equipped with a single laser and single optical sensor.
How does it work?
• Zebra AltiZ uses the principle of laser triangulation, projecting a laser line—also referred to as a sheet of light—
onto an object or scene, which is then viewed by not just one but two opposed image sensors. The laser line
bends to follow the depth/height contour of the object at the plane of intersection
• An algorithm running inside Zebra AltiZ analyses the bending of the laser line to establish the depth/height (and
width) in world units. The remaining dimension (length) is constructed by either moving the 3D profile sensor over
the object or by moving the object under the stationary 3D profile sensor. A profile is determined at regular inter-
vals during said motion. The accumulation of profiles is then used to construct the digital representation in three
dimensions: depth/height along the width and in turn across the length
• Simultaneous viewing of the laser line by two opposed optical sensors reduces the occlusion effect caused by
obstruction of the laser line from the view of a single image sensor because of a surface’s orientation. The figure
below compares a 3D point cloud produced with two opposed optical sensors (left) versus a single optical sensor
(right)
• Zebra AltiZ’s two optical sensors can also be made to view the laser line in an alternating fashion, doubling the
maximum scanning speed while still mitigating the occlusion effect to a slightly lesser extent

Classification steps
Zebra Design Assistant X includes classification steps for
automatically categorizing image content using machine learning.
These steps make use of deep learning technology—specifically the
convolutional neural network (CNN) and variants—in two distinct
approaches.
The first or global approach—implemented by the CNNClassIndex
step—assigns images or image regions to pre-established classes.
It lends itself to identification tasks where the goal is to distinguish
between similarly looking objects including those with slight
imperfections. The results for each image or image region consist of
the most likely class and a score for each class.
The second or segmentation approach—implemented by the
CNNClassMap step—generates maps indicating the pre-established
class and score for all image pixels. It is appropriate for detection tasks
CNNClassIndex step
where the objective is to determine the incidence, location, and extent
of flaws or features. These features can then be further analyzed and
measured using traditional tools like the BlobAnalysis step. These
classification steps are particularly well suited for analyzing images of
highly textured, naturally varying, and acceptably deformed goods in
complex and varying scenes.
Users can opt to train a deep neural network on their own—using the
included MIL CoPilot application—or commission Zebra Imaging to do
so using previously collected images that are both adequate in number
and representative of the expected application conditions. Different types
of training are supported, such as transfer learning and fine-tuning, all
starting from one of the supplied pre-defined deep neural network
architectures. MIL CoPilot provides what is needed for building
the required training dataset—including the labeling of images and
augmenting the dataset with synthesized images—as well as monitoring
and analyzing the training process. Training is accomplished using a
NIVIDIA GPU3,4 or x64-based CPU while inference is performed on a
CPU in a Zebra Imaging vision controller, smart camera, or third-
party computer, avoiding the need for specialized GPU hardware.

1D and 2D measurement steps
Zebra Design Assistant X includes three steps for measuring:
Measurement, BeadInspection, and Metrology. These tools are
predominantly used to assess manufacturing quality.
The Measurement step uses the projection of image intensity to
very quickly locate and measure straight edges or stripes within a
carefully defined rectangular region. The tool can make several 1D
measurements on edges and stripes, as well as between edges or
stripes.
The BeadInspection step is for inspecting material that is applied
as a continuous sinuous bead, such as adhesives and sealants, or
its retaining channel. The step identifies discrepancies in length,
placement, and width, as well as discontinuities. The BeadInspection
step works by accepting a user-defined coarse path as a list of points Measurement step
on a reference bead and then automatically and optimally placing
search boxes to form a template. The size and spacing of these
search boxes can be modified to change the sampling resolution. The
allowable bead width, offset, gap, and overall acceptance measure
can be adjusted to meet specific inspection criteria.
The Metrology step is intended for 2D geometric dimensioning and
tolerancing applications. The step extracts edges within defined
regions to best fit geometric features. It also supports the construction
of geometric features derived from measured ones or defined
mathematically. Geometric features include arcs, circles, points, and
segments. The step validates tolerances based on the dimensions,
positions, and shapes of geometric features. The Metrology step can
also analyze profiles obtained from 3D profile sensors or extracted
from point clouds and depth maps.
The Metrology step’s effectiveness is maintained when subject
to uneven changes in scene illumination, which relaxes lighting

requirements. The expected measured and constructed geometric
features, along with the tolerances, are kept together in a template

Color analysis steps
Zebra Design Assistant X includes a set of tools to identify parts,
products, and items using color, assess quality from color, and isolate
features using color.
The ColorMatcher step determines the best matching color from a
collection of samples for each region of interest within an image. A
color sample can be specified either interactively from an image—
with the ability to mask out undesired colors—or using numerical
values. A color sample can be a single color or a distribution of
colors (i.e., a histogram). The color matching method and the
interpretation of color differences can be manually adjusted to suit
particular application requirements. The ColorMatcher step can also
match each image pixel to color samples to segment the image into
appropriate elements for further analysis using other steps such as
BlobAnalysis.
The ImageProcessing step includes operations to calculate the color
distance and perform color projection. The distance operation reveals
the extent of color differences within and between images, while the
projection operation enhances color to grayscale image conversion
for analysis using other grayscale processing steps.

Character recognition steps
Zebra Design Assistant X provides two steps for character
recognition: SureDotOCR and StringReader. These steps combine
to read text that is engraved, etched, marked, printed, punched, or
stamped on surfaces.
The SureDotOCR step is uniquely designed for the specific challenge
of reading dot-matrix text produced by inkjet printers and dot peen
markers. Its use is straightforward, just needing to specify the dot
size, the number of characters in a text string, and the dimension—but
not the location—of the text region. The step reads strings located
at any angle, with varying contrast, and on an uneven background.
It interprets distorted characters and handles some variability to
character scale. The step recognizes punctuation marks and blank
spaces. It includes pre-defined fonts that can be edited. The step
automatically reads multiple lines of text where each line can be in
a different font. It supports user-defined constraints, overall and at
specific character positions, to further enhance recognition rates. The
SureDotOCR step provides greater robustness and flexibility than
case-specific techniques that convert dot-matrix characters into solid
ones for reading with traditional character recognition tools.
SureDotOCR step
The StringReader step is based on a sophisticated technique that
uses geometric features to quickly locate and read text made up of
solid characters in images where these characters are well separated
from the background and from one another. It handles text strings
with a known or unknown number of evenly or proportionally spaced
characters. The step accommodates changes in character angle
with respect to the string, aspect ratio, scale, and skew, as well as
contrast reversal. It accepts strings located across multiple lines
and at a slight angle. The step reads from multiple pre-defined or
user-defined Latin-based fonts. It supports user-defined constraints,
overall and at specific character positions, to further increase
recognition rates.

3D analysis and processing
Zebra Design Assistant X is able to inspect the data produced by 3D
cameras and sensors using the previously mentioned 2D or additional
3D-specifc analysis and processing steps. An AlignPlane step is available
to re-align the reference or resting surface in a depth map or point
cloud to remove disruptive perspective prior to ensuing operations. A
Project3D step (as well as an option in the Camera step) is included to
obtain a suitable depth map from a point cloud for use with 2D analysis
and processing steps. A FillGaps step (as well as an option in the Camera
step) is provided to fill in voids and replace invalid data in a depth map.
An ExtractProfile step is on hand to extract a profile from a depth map
or point cloud for analysis using the Metrology step. A Volume3D step is
available to compute the volume of a depth map as well as a point cloud
whose surface is meshed and filled. A Crop3D step (as well as an option
in the AlignPlane and Volume3D steps) is present to pull out a portion of
interest from a point cloud.

Software environment
Zebra Iris GTX smart cameras are ready to run applications developed using the Zebra Design Assistant X integrated
development environment (IDE) for Microsoft® Windows®. Users can easily configure flowcharts to create machine vision
applications, rather than write program code. The IDE also lets users design a graphical web-based operator interface for
the application. The flowchart-based approach streamlines development to get applications up and running quickly.
